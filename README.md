# Portfolio-Project
A web app for expense management with implemented authentication and authorization.

# Background
I didn't want to build another __Clone Project__ or a simple __CRUD APP__.
I wanted to build a web application from scratch to showcase some of my skills and ideas as a Frontend Developer using new technologies.
